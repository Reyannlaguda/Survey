Our proposed architecture leverages the inherent accuracy of tensor neural networks, while incorporating evolutionary parameters that enable remarkable extrapolation capabilities. By adopting innovative parameter update strategies, the pETNNs achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining precision and robustness. Notably, the pETNNs enhance the accuracy of conventional evolutional deep neural networks and empowers computational abilities to address high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the pETNNs in solving time-dependent complex equations, including the Navier-Stokes equations, high-dimensional heat equation, high-dimensional transport equation and Korteweg-de Vries type equation.","Sun, 10 Mar 2024 04:05:45 UTC (2,453 KB)"

The multi-component reacting flows are ubiquitous in many situations, with high-order FDM schemes used and calculation of reaction source integration, their numerical simulations are time-consuming to achieve high accuracy and capture the underlying multiscale features, and GPU-based acceleration methods are extremely helpful. At the same time, various accelerators have been released in the market, leading to a challenge of applications' adaptability. Based on an implementation of a heterogeneous programming standard, SYCL, it is now possible to develop heterogeneous parallel acceleration applications directly targeting multi-core CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, as well as Intel without translating any source code, demonstrating its high portability. MPI library is used to extend the solver to multi-GPU accelerated computing, with the GPU-ENABLED MPI technology supporting the direct data transmission between GPUs to reduce communication latency, and the weak-scaling and strong-scaling efficiency tested. This solver has been validated by several benchmark cases, including shock tube problems, diffusion problems, nitrogen dissociation problems, shock-bubble interaction problems, etc.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 13:28:42 UTC (2,703 KB)"
"3","OmniJet-$Î±$: The first cross-task foundation model for particle physics","Joschka Birk, Anna Hallin, Gregor Kasieczka","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","Foundation models are multi-dataset and multi-task machine learning methods that once pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a large variety of downstream applications. The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data. We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 19:00:01 UTC (2,221 KB)"

The simulation data were gathered using the Rat-Pac software, which was built on the Geant4 architecture. The use of the WbLS medium has the capability to generate both Scintillation and Cherenkov light inside a single detector. To show the separation power of these two physics events, we will use the supervised learning approach. The assessment utilized a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, with the ROC curve indicating a performance result of $0.96 \pm 1.2\times 10^{-4}$. The research also aimed to identify essential parameters for effectively distinguishing these physics events through machine learning. For this, the study also introduced the SHAP methodology, utilizing game theory to assess feature contributions. The findings demonstrated that the number of hits has a significant effect on the trained model, while the mean hit time has a somewhat smaller impact.

"5","Inverse Design of Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers is a Sequence Modeling Problem","Ceyao Zhang, Renjie Li, Cheng Zhang, Zhaoyu Zhang, Feng Yin","Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)","Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL)'s inverse design demands expert knowledge in physics, materials science, and quantum mechanics which is prohibitively labor-intensive. Advanced AI technologies, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have emerged as a powerful tool to augment and accelerate this inverse design process. By modeling the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequential decision-making problem, RL approaches can construct a satisfactory PCSEL structure from scratch. However, the data inefficiency resulting from online interactions with precise and expensive simulation environments impedes the broader applicability of RL approaches. Recently, sequential models, especially the Transformer architecture, have exhibited compelling performance in sequential decision-making problems due to their simplicity and scalability to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named PCSEL Inverse Design Transformer (PiT) that abstracts the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequence modeling problem. The central part of our PiT is a Transformer-based structure that leverages the past trajectories and current states to predict the current actions. Compared with the traditional RL approaches, PiT can output the optimal actions and achieve target PCSEL designs by leveraging offline data and conditioning on the desired return. Results demonstrate that PiT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 08:38:50 UTC (2,445 KB)"

This is caused for instance by limits in what physical processes are simulated and to what accuracy. In this work we propose and analyze the use of an LSTM-based deep learning network machine learning (ML) architecture for capturing and predicting the behavior of the systemic error for storm surge forecast models with respect to real-world water height observations from gauge stations during hurricane events. The overall goal of this work is to predict the systemic error of the physics model and use it to improve the accuracy of the simulation results post factum. We trained our proposed ML model on a dataset of 61 historical storms in the coastal regions of the U.S. and we tested its performance in bias correcting modeled water level data predictions from hurricane Ian (2022). We show that our model can consistently improve the forecasting accuracy for hurricane Ian -- unknown to the ML model -- at all gauge station coordinates used for the initial data. Moreover, by examining the impact of using different subsets of the initial training dataset, containing a number of relatively similar or different hurricanes in terms of hurricane track, we found that we can obtain similar quality of bias correction by only using a subset of six hurricanes. This is an important result that implies the possibility to apply a pre-trained ML model to real-time hurricane forecasting results with the goal of bias correcting and improving the produced simulation accuracy. The presented work is an important first step in creating a bias correction system for real-time storm surge forecasting applicable to the full simulation area. It also presents a highly transferable and operationally applicable methodology for improving the accuracy in a wide range of physics simulation scenarios beyond storm surge forecasting.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 13:19:38 UTC (10,920 KB)"

Abiotic factors such as pH, nutrient availability, and soil composition significantly affect root morphology and architecture. Of particular interest is the impact of nutrient flow on thigmomorphogenesis, a response to mechanical stimulation in early root growth, which remains largely unexplored. This study explores the intricate factors influencing early root system development, with a focus on the cooperative correlation between nutrient uptake and its flow dynamics. Using physiologically relevant, portable, and cost-effective microfluidic system for the controlled fluid environments offering hydraulic conductivity comparable to that of the soil, this study analyzes the interplay between nutrient flow and root growth post-germination. Emphasizing the relationship between root growth and nitrogen uptake, the findings reveal that nutrient flow significantly influences early root morphology, leading to increased length and improved nutrient uptake, varying with the flow rate. The experimental findings are supported by stress-related fluid flow-root interaction simulations and quantitative determination of nitrogen uptake using the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method. The microfluidic approach offers novel insights into plant root dynamics under controlled flow conditions, filling a critical research gap. By providing a high-resolution platform, this study contributes to the understanding of how fluid-flow assisted nutrient uptake and pressure affect root-cell behavior, which, in turn, induces mechanical stress leading to thigmomorphogenesis. The findings hold implications for comprehending root responses to changing environmental conditions, paving the way for innovative agricultural and environmental management strategies.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 05:29:25 UTC (1,917 KB)"

The effectiveness of GenML is validated through quantitative analyses of autocorrelation functions and diffusion behaviors, showcasing its capability to accurately replicate theoretical noise properties.

Walsh, Greg Pickrell, Fabio Semperlotti","Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)","This work presents a physics-driven machine learning framework for the simulation of acoustic scattering problems. The proposed framework relies on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that leverages prior knowledge based on the physics of the scattering problem as well as a tailored network structure that embodies the concept of the superposition principle of linear wave interaction. The framework can also simulate the scattered field due to rigid scatterers having arbitrary shape as well as high-frequency problems. Unlike conventional data-driven neural networks, the PINN is trained by directly enforcing the governing equations describing the underlying physics, hence without relying on any labeled training dataset. Remarkably, the network model has significantly lower discretization dependence and offers simulation capabilities akin to parallel computation. This feature is particularly beneficial to address computational challenges typically associated with conventional mesh-dependent simulation methods. The performance of the network is investigated via a comprehensive numerical study that explores different application scenarios based on acoustic scattering.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 22:45:52 UTC (6,638 KB)"

Golwala","Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)","Two-level systems (TLS) are an important, if not dominant, source of loss and noise for superconducting resonators such as those used in kinetic inductance detectors and some quantum information science platforms. They are similarly important for loss in photolithographically fabricated superconducting mm-wave/THz transmission lines. For both lumped-element and transmission-line structures, native amorphous surface oxide films are typically the sites of such TLS in non-microstripline geometries, while loss in the (usually amorphous) dielectric film itself usually dominates in microstriplines. We report here on the demonstration of low TLS loss at GHz frequencies in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in superconducting lumped-element resonators using parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs). The values we obtain from two recipes in different deposition machines, 7$\,\times\,10^{-6}$ and 12$\,\times\,10^{-6}$, improve on the best achieved in the literature by a factor of 2--4 for a-Si:H and are comparable to recent measurements of amorphous germanium. Moreover, we have taken care to extract the true zero-temperature, low-field loss tangent of these films, accounting for temperature and field saturation effects that can yield misleading results. Such robustly fabricated and characterized films render the use of PPCs with deposited amorphous films a viable architecture for superconducting resonators, and they also promise extremely low loss and high quality factor for photolithographically fabricated superconducting mm-wave/THz transmission lines used in planar antennas and resonant filters.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 08:27:53 UTC (1,851 KB)"

Clark","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:37:21 UTC (2,785 KB)"

One of the simplest possible responses, reversing the direction of motion, is believed to enable filamentous cyanobacteria to form stable aggregates or accumulate in suitable light conditions. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous morphology in combination with responding to light gradients by reversals has consequences far beyond simple accumulation: Entangled aggregates form at the boundaries of illuminated regions, harnessing the boundary to establish local order. We explore how the light pattern, in particular its boundary curvature, impacts aggregation. A minimal mechanistic model of active flexible filaments resembles the experimental findings, thereby revealing the emergent and generic character of these structures. This phenomenon may enable elongated microorganisms to generate adaptive colony architectures in limited habitats, or guide the assembly of biomimetic fibrous materials.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 16:25:05 UTC (42,159 KB)"

Implementing these complex deep neural networks on conventional hardware is highly inefficient. In this work, we propose hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks, using spintronic devices. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, ReLU, and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions.

"15","Greedy receiver for photon-efficient optical communication","Karol Åukanowski","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output. Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 03:57:54 UTC (385 KB)"

Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ansÃ¤tze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have on parameter estimation.

They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling.

Sutherland","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:52:14 UTC (864 KB)"

The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule.

However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:14:50 UTC (220 KB)"

High-throughput computational material screenings have been a promising approach to filter databases and identify new p-type TC candidates, and some of these predictions have been experimentally validated. However, most of these predicted candidates do not have experimentally-achieved properties on par with n-type TCs used in solar cells, and therefore have not yet been used in commercial devices. Thus, there is still a significant divide between transforming predictions into results that are actually achievable in the lab, and an even greater lag in scaling predicted materials into functional devices. In this perspective, we outline some of the major disconnects in this materials discovery process -- from scaling computational predictions into synthesizable crystals and thin films in the laboratory, to scaling lab-grown films into real-world solar devices -- and share insights to inform future strategies for TC discovery and design.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 17:27:05 UTC (10,565 KB)"

Herein, we present a solvent-free approach to growing single-crystal organic nanowires (ONW), nanoporous metal oxide scaffolds, and HP to form a core@multishell architecture. The synthetic procedure is carried out under mild vacuum conditions employing thermal evaporation for the metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) nanowires, which will be the core, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for the TiO2 shell, and co-evaporation of lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I / MAI) for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3 / MAPI) perovskite shell. We present a detailed characterization of the nanostructures by (S)-TEM and XRD, revealing a different crystallization of the hybrid perovskite depending on the template: while the growth on H2Pc nanowires induces the typical tetragonal structure of the MAPI perovskite, a low-dimensional phase (LDP) was observed on the one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes. Such a combination yields an unprecedentedly stable photoluminescence emission over 20 hours and over 300 hours after encapsulation in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under different atmospheres including N2, air, and high moisture levels.

In this work, we assess the feasibility of deploying laser sail technology in precursor life-detection missions. We investigate such laser sail missions to Enceladus and Europa, as these two moons emit plumes that seem accessible to in situ sampling. Our study suggests that GigaWatt laser technology could accelerate a $100$ kg probe to a speed of $\sim{30}\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}}$, thereupon reaching Europa on timescales of $1$-$4$ years and Enceladus with flight times of $3$-$6$ years. Although the ideal latitudes for the laser array vary, placing the requisite infrastructure close to either the Antarctic or Arctic Circles might represent technically viable options for an Enceladus mission. Crucially, we determine that the minimum encounter velocities with these moons (about ${6}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) may be near-optimal for detecting biomolecular building blocks (e.g., amino acids) in the plumes by means of a mass spectrometer akin to the Surface Dust Analyzer onboard the \emph{Europa Clipper} mission.

At the core of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubits gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square error smaller than 0.05.

A particularly challenging task is the forecasting of timeseries generated by chaotic dynamics. In recent years reservoir computing has been shown to be an effective method of forecasting chaotic dynamics and reconstructing chaotic attractors from data. In this work strides are made toward smaller and lower complexity reservoirs with the goal of improved hardware implementability and more reliable production of adequate surrogate models. We show that a reservoir of uncoupled nodes more reliably produces long term timeseries predictions than complex reservoir topologies. We then link the improved attractor reconstruction of the uncoupled reservoir with smaller spectral radii of the resulting surrogate systems. These results indicate that, the node degree plays an important role in determining whether the desired dynamics will be stable in the autonomous surrogate system which is attained via closed-loop operation of the trained reservoir. In terms of hardware implementability, uncoupled nodes would allow for greater freedom in the hardware architecture because no complex coupling setups are needed and because, for uncoupled nodes, the system response is equivalent for space and time multiplexing.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:43:52 UTC (7,225 KB)"

Uncertainty estimation is essential to quantify this error, and make application of data-centric approaches more trustworthy. To ensure that uncertainty quantification is used widely, one should aim for algorithms that are reasonably accurate, but also easy to implement and apply. In particular, including uncertainty quantification on top of an existing architecture should be straightforward, and add minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, it should be easy to manipulate or combine multiple machine-learning predictions, propagating uncertainty over further modeling steps. We compare several well-established uncertainty quantification frameworks against these requirements, and propose a practical approach, which we dub direct propagation of shallow ensembles, that provides a good compromise between ease of use and accuracy. We present benchmarks for generic datasets, and an in-depth study of applications to the field of atomistic machine learning for chemistry and materials.

The new method is applied to identify circulation patterns over the Mediterranean region targeted to precipitation over Morocco and compared to three existing approaches, two established linear methods and another machine learning approach. The RMM-VAE method identifies regimes that are more predictive of the target variable compared to the two linear methods, and more robust and persistent compared to the alternative machine learning method, while also improving the reconstruction of the input space.

Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the mechanical pumping efficiency, calculated from the pressure rise and flow rate, reaches a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge $E. muelleri$, as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping efficiency. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and body design of sponges.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:05:05 UTC (5,462 KB)"

To increase the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of weak signal detection as well as to directly obtain the position information, we exploit the machine-learning model of random forests that combines the output of multiple decision trees to give optimal values of the physical quantities of interest. In particular, from time-series data gathered from the cockpit of a flying airplane during various maneuvering stages, where strong background complex signals are caused by other elements of the Earth's magnetic field and the fields produced by the electronic systems in the cockpit, we demonstrate that the random-forest algorithm performs remarkably well in detecting the weak anomaly field and in filtering the position of the aircraft. With the aid of the conventional inertial navigation system, the positioning error can be reduced to less than 10 meters. We also find that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the classic Tolles-Lawson model for calibrating and removing the magnetic field generated by the body of the aircraft is not necessary and may even be detrimental for the success of the random-forest method.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 21:10:12 UTC (8,537 KB)"
"52","Stability-Aware Training of Neural Network Interatomic Potentials with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators","Sanjeev Raja, Ishan Amin, Fabian Pedregosa, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Neural network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations which sample unphysical states, limiting their usefulness for modeling phenomena occurring over longer timescales. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which combines conventional supervised training from quantum-mechanical energies and forces with reference system observables, to produce stable and accurate NNIPs. StABlE Training iteratively runs MD simulations to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. The training procedure is enabled by the Boltzmann Estimator, which allows efficient computation of gradients required to train neural networks to system observables, and can detect both global and local instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, along with using three modern NNIP architectures. In all three cases, StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability and recovery of structural and dynamic observables. In some cases, StABlE-trained models outperform conventional models trained on datasets 50 times larger. As a general framework applicable across NNIP architectures and systems, StABlE Training is a powerful tool for training stable and accurate NNIPs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 18:12:07 UTC (41,617 KB)"

Leonardo da Vinci described geometric proportions in trees to provide both guidelines for painting and insights into tree form and function. Da Vinci's Rule of trees further implies fractal branching with a particular scaling exponent $\alpha = 2$ governing both proportions between the diameters of adjoining boughs and the number of boughs of a given diameter. Contemporary biology increasingly supports an analogous rule with $\alpha = 3$ known as Murray's Law. Here we relate trees in art to a theory of proportion inspired by both da Vinci and modern tree physiology. We measure $\alpha$ in 16th century Islamic architecture, Edo period Japanese painting and 20th century European art, finding $\alpha$ in the range 1.5 to 2.5. We find that both conformity and deviations from ideal branching create stylistic effect and accommodate constraints on design and implementation. Finally, we analyze an abstract tree by Piet Mondrian which forgoes explicit branching but accurately captures the modern scaling exponent $\alpha = 3$, anticipating Murray's Law by 15 years. This perspective extends classical mathematical, biological and artistic ways to understand, recreate and appreciate the beauty of trees.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 04:09:25 UTC (7,792 KB)"

We analyze these effects by studying three variants of training neural networks on discrete ground truth trajectories. In addition to commonly used one-step setups and fully differentiable unrolling, we include a third, less widely used variant: unrolling without temporal gradients. Comparing networks trained with these three modalities makes it possible to disentangle the two dominant effects of unrolling, training distribution shift and long-term gradients. We present a detailed study across physical systems, network sizes, network architectures, training setups, and test scenarios. It provides an empirical basis for our main findings: A non-differentiable but unrolled training setup supported by a numerical solver can yield 4.5-fold improvements over a fully differentiable prediction setup that does not utilize this solver. We also quantify a difference in the accuracy of models trained in a fully differentiable setup compared to their non-differentiable counterparts. While differentiable setups perform best, the accuracy of unrolling without temporal gradients comes comparatively close. Furthermore, we empirically show that these behaviors are invariant to changes in the underlying physical system, the network architecture and size, and the numerical scheme. These results motivate integrating non-differentiable numerical simulators into training setups even if full differentiability is unavailable. We also observe that the convergence rate of common neural architectures is low compared to numerical algorithms. This encourages the use of hybrid approaches combining neural and numerical algorithms to utilize the benefits of both.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 12:40:31 UTC (15,901 KB)"

One promising approach is to use a neural network based model, trained using data generated from repeated solution of an expensive small scale model, as a surrogate for the small scale model in application scale simulations. Such approaches have been shown to have the potential accuracy of concurrent multiscale methods like FE2, but at the cost comparable to empirical methods like classical constitutive models or parameter passing. A key question is to understand how much and what kind of data is necessary to obtain an accurate surrogate. This paper examines this question for history dependent elastic-plastic behavior of an architected metamaterial modeled as a truss. We introduce an iterative approach where we use the rich arbitrary class of trajectories to train an initial model, but then iteratively update the class of trajectories with those that arise in large scale simulation and use transfer learning to update the model. We show that such an approach converges to a highly accurate surrogate, and one that is transferable.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 02:46:32 UTC (13,299 KB)"

Prior work on polariton condensate lattices has primarily been on GaAs-based systems, with the recent advent of organic molecules and perovskite systems allowing room-temperature operation. However, in most of these room temperature systems, the lattices are defined using a bottom-up approach by patterning the bottom mirrors, significantly limiting the types of lattices and refractive index contrast that can be realized.

In particular, neural network models have proved to be adept at modeling processes with spatial-temporal complexity. Nevertheless, these highly parameterized models have garnered skepticism in their ability to produce outputs with quantified error bounds over the regimes of interest. Hence there is a need to find uncertainty quantification methods that are suitable for neural networks. In this work we present comparisons of the parametric uncertainty quantification of neural networks modeling complex spatial-temporal processes with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Stein variational gradient descent and its projected variant. Specifically we apply these methods to graph convolutional neural network models of evolving systems modeled with recurrent neural network and neural ordinary differential equations architectures. We show that Stein variational inference is a viable alternative to Monte Carlo methods with some clear advantages for complex neural network models. For our exemplars, Stein variational interference gave similar uncertainty profiles through time compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, albeit with generally more generous variance.Projected Stein variational gradient descent also produced similar uncertainty profiles to the non-projected counterpart, but large reductions in the active weight space were confounded by the stability of the neural network predictions and the convoluted likelihood landscape.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 03:19:23 UTC (2,293 KB)"

This topic encompasses a broad array of methods and models aimed at solving a single or a collection of PDE problems, called multitask learning. PIML is characterized by the incorporation of physical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of large data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this collection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark, and generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this metric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute lower accuracy bounds and analyze the model's learned basis functions on various PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing multitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation from selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of improvement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function, which can drastically affect model generalization to ""worst-case"" scenarios, which is not observed when reporting task-specific errors. We also incorporate this metric into the optimization process through regularization, which improves the models' generalizability over the multitask PDE problem.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 23:21:40 UTC (31,127 KB)"

However, such architectures, due to their traditional realization based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material platform, face two shortcomings. First, the high-index contrast of the SOI platform incurs high scattering losses, which mandates the provisioning of high optical input power.Second, SOI waveguides are susceptible to two-photon absorption, which can incur substantial optical signal losses at moderate-to-high signal fan-in. These shortcomings have severely detrimental effects on the achievable parallelism, throughput, and energy efficiency of SOI MRR-based GEMM accelerators.

SiNPhAR architecture employs SiN-based active and passive devices to implement analog GEMM functions. Since the SiN material exhibits lower index contrast and no TPA, the optical signal losses in our SiNPhAR architecture are very low.

Methods: NLINV-Net is a model-based neural network architecture that directly estimates images and coil sensitivities from (radial) k-space data via non-linear inversion (NLINV). Combined with a training strategy using self-supervision via data undersampling (SSDU), it can be used for imaging problems where no ground truth reconstructions are available. We validated the method for (1) real-time cardiac imaging and (2) single-shot subspace-based quantitative T1 mapping. Furthermore, region-optimized virtual (ROVir) coils were used to suppress artifacts stemming from outside the FoV and to focus the k-space based SSDU loss on the region of interest. NLINV-Net based reconstructions were compared with conventional NLINV and PI-CS (parallel imaging + compressed sensing) reconstruction and the effect of the region-optimized virtual coils and the type of training loss was evaluated qualitatively. Results: NLINV-Net based reconstructions contain significantly less noise than the NLINV-based counterpart. ROVir coils effectively suppress streakings which are not suppressed by the neural networks while the ROVir-based focussed loss leads to visually sharper time series for the movement of the myocardial wall in cardiac real-time imaging. For quantitative imaging, T1-maps reconstructed using NLINV-Net show similar quality as PI-CS reconstructions, but NLINV-Net does not require slice-specific tuning of the regularization parameter.

Here, we introduce a 3D-2D Phase Retrieval U-Net (PRUNe) that takes noisy and randomly phase-shifted interferograms as inputs, and outputs a single 2D phase image. A 3D downsampling convolutional encoder captures correlations within and between frames to produce a 2D latent space, which is upsampled by a 2D decoder into a phase image. We test our model against a state-of-the-art singular value decomposition algorithm and find PRUNe reconstructions consistently show more accurate and smooth reconstructions, with a x2.5 - 4 lower mean squared error at multiple signal-to-noise ratios for interferograms with low (< 1 photon/pixel) and high (~100 photons/pixel) signal intensity. Our model presents a faster and more accurate approach to perform phase retrieval in extremely low light intensity interferometry in presence of phase noise, and will find application in other multi-frame noisy imaging techniques.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 21:19:16 UTC (2,264 KB)"

The geometry of X-ray micro-CT scanners is similar to the medical CT machines, except the sample is rotated with a stationary source and detector. The ring artifacts are caused by a defect or non-linear responses in detector pixels during the MicroCT data acquisition. Artifacts in MicroCT images can often be so severe that the images are no longer useful for further analysis. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the causes of artifacts and potential solutions to maximize image quality. This article presents a convolution neural network (CNN)-based Deep Learning (DL) model inspired by UNet with a series of encoder and decoder units with skip connections for removal of ring artifacts. The proposed architecture has been evaluated using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, the results are compared with conventional filter-based non-ML techniques and are found to be better than the latter.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 14:23:24 UTC (5,331 KB)"

Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are promising as such models, in which various vector operations model the atomic interaction with its neighbors. However, conventional MPNNs tend to overlook the importance of physicochemical information for each node atom, relying solely on the geometric features of the material graph. We propose the new three-body MPNN architecture with a message-passing layer that utilizes optimized basis functions based on the electronic structure of the node elemental species. This enables conveying the message that includes physical information and better represents the interaction for each elemental species. Inspired by the LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) method, a classical method for calculating the orbital interactions, the linear combination of atomic basis constructed based on the wave function of hydrogen-like atoms is used for the present message-passing. Our model achieved higher prediction accuracy with smaller parameters than the state-of-the-art models on the challenging crystalline dataset containing many elemental species, including heavy elements. Ablation studies have also shown that the proposed method is effective in improving accuracy. Our implementation is available online.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 12:45:50 UTC (2,105 KB)"

However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and 10-ns $\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities of 0.9999 or higher. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 02:44:24 UTC (662 KB)"

[$^{18}$F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([$^{18}$F]-FDG PET) is used to monitor brain metabolism, aiding in the diagnosis and assessment of AD over time. However, the feasibility of multi-time point [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans for diagnosis is limited due to radiation exposure, cost, and patient burden. To address this, we have developed a predictive image-to-image translation (I2I) model to forecast future [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans using baseline and year-one data. The proposed model employs a convolutional neural network architecture with long-short term memory and was trained on [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET data from 161 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our I2I network showed high accuracy in predicting year-two [18F]-FDG PET scans, with a mean absolute error of 0.031 and a structural similarity index of 0.961. Furthermore, the model successfully predicted PET scans up to seven years post-baseline. Notably, the predicted [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET signal in an AD-susceptible meta-region was highly accurate for individuals with mild cognitive impairment across years. In contrast, a linear model was sufficient for predicting brain metabolism in cognitively normal and dementia subjects. In conclusion, both the I2I network and the linear model could offer valuable prognostic insights, guiding early intervention strategies to preemptively address anticipated declines in brain metabolism and potentially to monitor treatment effects.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 16:02:51 UTC (6,424 KB)"

Although traditional data-driven models have shown promise in this domain, their long-term prediction accuracy can be limited, especially in scenarios with sparse or incomplete data and they often rely on black-box deep learning structures that lack solid physical foundation leading to reduced transparency and interpretability in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel approach named Physics guided Neural Network for Air Quality Prediction (AirPhyNet).

Then, we utilize a graph structure to integrate physics knowledge into a neural network architecture and exploit latent representations to capture spatio-temporal relationships within the air quality data. Experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AirPhyNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for different testing scenarios including different lead time (24h, 48h, 72h), sparse data and sudden change prediction, achieving reduction in prediction errors up to 10%. Moreover, a case study further validates that our model captures underlying physical processes of particle movement and generates accurate predictions with real physical meaning.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 07:55:54 UTC (13,576 KB)[v2] Wed, 7 Feb 2024 02:10:11 UTC (13,576 KB)"

However, due to the poor contrast resolution of preclinical irradiator CBCT, these methods have been limited to high contrast - minimally anatomically complex - structures such as the heart and lungs. Thus, low contrast abdominal CBCT DL-based segmentation has yet to be addressed. In this work we explore a DL-based model in conjunction with iodine-based contrast agent approach to allow precise automatic contouring of mouse abdominal, thorax, and skeletal structures in under a second. Methods. A DL U-net-like architecture was trained to contour mice organs in small animal radiation research platform CBCT scans. 41 mice were contoured by a human expert, using semi-automatic segmentation methods, after injection of iodine contrast agent, establishing a ground truth for the DL model. The model was trained on a dataset of 26 mice, while 2 mice were used for validation, tuning the model during training, and 15 mice used for performance evaluation testing. The model consists of a pre-processor, and a post-processor for volumetric reconstruction of the DL-predicted probability maps. Model performance was evaluated using both qualitative and distance metrics, including the dice similarity score, precision score, Hausdorff Distance (HD), and mean surface distance (MSD). Results. Performance of the DL-based iodine contrast-enhanced model provided high quality predicted contours in under a second, with the median for all organs being reported: dice $>$ 91\%, precision $>$ 95\%, HD50 $<$ 1.0 mm, and MSD $<$ 1.41 mm.

This study introduces a novel approach by applying the principles of gauge symmetries, a key concept in physics, to neural network architectures. By regarding model functions as physical observables, we find that parametric redundancies of various machine learning models can be interpreted as gauge symmetries. We mathematically formulate the parametric redundancies in neural ODEs, and find that their gauge symmetries are given by spacetime diffeomorphisms, which play a fundamental role in Einstein's theory of gravity. Viewing neural ODEs as a continuum version of feedforward neural networks, we show that the parametric redundancies in feedforward neural networks are indeed lifted to diffeomorphisms in neural ODEs. We further extend our analysis to transformer models, finding natural correspondences with neural ODEs and their gauge symmetries.

Goldman","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 18:07:40 UTC (719 KB)"

Among photonic devices, programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have shown promise in solving large scale Ising model problems to which many computationally hard problems can be mapped. Despite much progress, existing SLMs for solving the Ising model and similar problems suffer from slow update rates and physical bulkiness.

An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 03:34:41 UTC (21,243 KB)"

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by these biological counterparts, have emerged as powerful tools for deciphering intricate data patterns and making predictions. However, conventional ANNs can be viewed as ""point estimates"" that do not capture the uncertainty of prediction, which is an inherently probabilistic process. In contrast, treating an ANN as a probabilistic model derived via Bayesian inference poses significant challenges for conventional deterministic computing architectures. Here, we use chaotic light in combination with incoherent photonic data processing to enable high-speed probabilistic computation and uncertainty quantification. Since both the chaotic light source and the photonic crossbar support multiple independent computational wavelength channels, we sample from the output distributions in parallel at a sampling rate of 70.4 GS/s, limited only by the electronic interface. We exploit the photonic probabilistic architecture to simultaneously perform image classification and uncertainty prediction via a Bayesian neural network. Our prototype demonstrates the seamless cointegration of a physical entropy source and a computational architecture that enables ultrafast probabilistic computation by parallel sampling.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:27:38 UTC (4,338 KB)"

Our KIDs have a lumped-element architecture with parallel plate capacitors and aluminum inductors. The incoming light is received with a hierarchical phased array of slot-dipole antennas, split into 4 frequency bands (between 125 GHz and 365 GHz) with on-chip lumped-element band-pass filters, and routed to different KIDs using microstriplines. Individual pixels detect light for the 3 higher frequency bands (190-365 GHz) and the signals from four individual pixels are coherently summed to create a larger pixel detecting light for the lowest-frequency band (125-175 GHz). The spectral response of the band-pass filters was measured using Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS), the far-field beam pattern of the phased-array antennas was obtained using an infrared source mounted on a 2-axis translating stage, and the optical efficiency of the KIDs was characterized by observing loads at 294 K and 77 K.

There are multiple multiplexing architectures for SNSPDs that are already in use, but FDM could prove superior in applications where the operational bias currents are very low, especially for mid- and far-infrared SNSPDs. Previous FDM schemes integrated the SNSPD within the resonator, while in this work we use an external resonator, which gives more flexibility to optimize the SNSPD architecture. The KPUP is a DC-biased superconducting resonator in which a nanowire is used as its inductive element to enable sensitivity to current perturbations. When coupled to an SNSPD, the KPUP can be used to read out current pulses on the few $\mu$A scale. The KPUP is made out of NbTiN, which has high non-linear kinetic inductance for increased sensitivity at higher current bias and high operating temperature. Meanwhile, the SNSPD is made from WSi, which is a popular material for broadband SNSPDs. To read out the KPUP and SNSPD array, a software-defined radio platform and a graphics processing unit are used.

In order to assist forecasters in warning the public, several algorithms have been developed to automatically detect tornadic signatures in weather radar observations. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which learn directly from large amounts of labeled data, have been shown to be highly effective for this purpose. Since tornadoes are extremely rare events within the corpus of all available radar observations, the selection and design of training datasets for ML applications is critical for the performance, robustness, and ultimate acceptance of ML algorithms.

However, current ONNs face various challenges,most significantly a limited calculation precision (typically around 4 bits) and the requirement for high-resolution signal format converters (digital-to-analogue conversions (DACs) and analogue-to-digital conversions (ADCs)). These challenges are inherent to their analog computing nature and pose significant obstacles in practical implementation. Here, we propose a digital-analog hybrid optical computing architecture for ONNs, which utilizes digital optical inputs in the form of binary words. By introducing the logic levels and decisions based on thresholding, the calculation precision can be significantly enhanced. The DACs for input data can be removed and the resolution of the ADCs can be greatly reduced. This can increase the operating speed at a high calculation precision and facilitate the compatibility with microelectronics. To validate our approach, we have fabricated a proof-of-concept photonic chip and built up a hybrid optical processor (HOP) system for neural network applications. We have demonstrated an unprecedented 16-bit calculation precision for high-definition image processing, with a pixel error rate (PER) as low as $1.8\times10^{-3}$ at an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 18.2 dB.

We report reactive additive capillary stamping under solvothermal conditions as a parallel contact-lithographic access to patterns of solvothermal reaction products in thin-layer configurations. To this end, corresponding precursor inks are infiltrated into mechanically robust mesoporous aerogel stamps derived from double-network hydrogels (DNHGs). The stamp is then brought into contact with a substrate to be patterned under solvothermal reaction conditions inside an autoclave. The precursor ink forms liquid bridges between the topographic surface pattern of the stamp and the substrate. Evaporation-driven enrichment of the precursors in these liquid bridges along with their liquid-bridge-guided conversion into the solvothermal reaction products yields large-area submicron patterns of the solvothermal reaction products replicating the stamp topography. As example, we prepared thin hybrid films, which contained ordered monolayers of superparamagnetic submicron nickel ferrite dots prepared by solvothermal capillary stamping surrounded by nickel electrodeposited in a second, orthogonal substrate functionalization step.

Misalignments here can lead to less accurate synthetic CT (sCT) images, impacting treatment precision. Purpose: This study introduces a novel network that cohesively unifies image generation and registration processes to enhance the quality and anatomical fidelity of sCTs derived from better-aligned MR images. Methods: The approach synergizes a generation network (G) with a deformable registration network (R), optimizing them jointly in MR-to-CT synthesis. This goal is achieved by alternately minimizing the discrepancies between the generated/registered CT images and their corresponding reference CT counterparts. The generation network employs a UNet architecture, while the registration network leverages an implicit neural representation of the Deformable Vector Fields (DVFs). We validated this method on a dataset comprising 60 Head-and-Neck patients, reserving 12 cases for holdout testing. Results: Compared to the baseline Pix2Pix method with MAE 124.95\pm 30.74 HU, the proposed technique demonstrated 80.98\pm 7.55 HU. The unified translation-registration network produced sharper and more anatomically congruent outputs, showing superior efficacy in converting MR images to sCTs. Additionally, from a dosimetric perspective, the plan recalculated on the resulting sCTs resulted in a remarkably reduced discrepancy to the reference proton plans. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates that a holistic MR-based CT synthesis approach, integrating both image-to-image translation and deformable registration, significantly improves the precision and quality of sCT generation, particularly for the challenging body area with varied anatomic changes between corresponding MR and CT.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 16:15:31 UTC (23,444 KB)"

The twin-microbottle resonator has a maximum diameter of 68 $\mu$m and length of 800 $\mu$m. By immersing one part of it in water and keeping the other part in air, the mechanical radial breathing mode can be read out sensitively while maintaining a high optical quality factor of the optical whispering gallery mode regardless of the water immersion. This high mechanical displacement sensitivity provides a frequency resolution that is high enough to measure the mechanical frequency shift due to the water immersion and resolves the water level to 2.6$\pm$0.9 pm. This unique liquid-level meter based on a highly sensitive cavity optomechanical setup can be used to detect tiny fluctuations of various air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 07:11:55 UTC (604 KB)"
"121","A two-circuit approach to reducing quantum resources for the quantum lattice Boltzmann method","Sriharsha Kocherla, Austin Adams, Zhixin Song, Alexander Alexeev, Spencer H. Bryngelson","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.","Sat, 20 Jan 2024 15:32:01 UTC (1,167 KB)"

Race","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","Microstructure is key to controlling and understanding the properties of metallic materials, but traditional approaches to describing microstructure capture only a small number of features. To enable data-centric approaches to materials discovery, allow efficient storage of microstructural data and assist in quality control in metals processing, we require more complete descriptors of microstructure. The concept of microstructural fingerprinting, using machine learning (ML) to develop quantitative, low-dimensional descriptors of microstructures, has recently attracted significant attention. However, it is difficult to interpret conclusions drawn by ML algorithms, which are commonly referred to as ""black boxes"". Here we explore variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be trained to produce microstructural fingerprints in a continuous latent space. VAEs enable the reconstruction of images from fingerprints, allowing us to explore how key features of microstructure are encoded. We develop a VAE architecture based on ResNet18 and train it on Ti-6Al-4V optical micrographs as an example of an industrially important alloy where microstructural control is critical to performance. The latent space is explored in several ways, including by supplying interpolated and randomly perturbed fingerprints to the trained decoder and via dimensionality reduction to explore the distribution of microstructural features within the latent space of fingerprints. We show that the VAE fingerprints exhibit smooth, interpolable behaviour with stability to local perturbations, supporting their suitability as general purpose descriptors for microstructure. We also show that key properties of the microstructures are strongly correlated with position in the latent space, supporting the use of VAE fingerprints for quantitative exploration of process-structure-property relationships.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 14:15:55 UTC (34,184 KB)"

Reaching system sizes of hundreds of long-lived qubits, these arrays are used for highly coherent analog quantum simulation, as well as digital quantum computation. Advanced quantum protocols such as quantum error correction, however, require midcircuit qubit operations, including the replenishment, reset, and readout of a subset of qubits. A compelling strategy to achieve these capabilities is a dual-species architecture in which a second atomic species can be controlled without crosstalk, and entangled with the first via Rydberg interactions. Here, we realize a dual-species Rydberg array consisting of rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms, and explore new regimes of interactions and dynamics not accessible in single-species architectures. We achieve enhanced interspecies interactions by electrically tuning the Rydberg states close to a Forster resonance. In this regime, we demonstrate interspecies Rydberg blockade and implement quantum state transfer from one species to another. We then generate a Bell state between Rb and Cs hyperfine qubits via an interspecies controlled-phase gate. Finally, we combine interspecies entanglement with native midcircuit readout to achieve quantum non-demolition measurement of a Rb qubit using an auxiliary Cs qubit. The techniques demonstrated here pave the way toward scalable measurement-based protocols and real-time feedback control in large-scale quantum systems.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 19:00:02 UTC (9,885 KB)"
"127","Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products","Shengjie Luo, Tianlang Chen, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 18:57:10 UTC (169 KB)"

Recently, active RIS has been proposed to compensate the multiplicative fading effect inherent in passive RISs. However, conventional distributed active RISs, with at least one amplifier per element, are costly, complex, and power-intensive. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel architecture of active RIS: the centralized active RIS (CA-RIS), which amplifies the energy using a centralized amplifying reflector to reduce the number of amplifiers. Under this architecture, only as low as one amplifier is needed for power amplification of the entire array, which can eliminate the mutual-coupling effect among amplifiers, and significantly reduce the cost, noise level, and power consumption. We evaluate the performance of CA-RIS, specifically its path loss, and compare it with conventional passive RISs, revealing a moderate amplification gain. Furthermore, the proposed CA-RIS and the path loss model are experimentally verified, achieving a 9.6 dB net gain over passive RIS at 4 GHz. The CA-RIS offers a substantial simplification of active RIS architecture while preserving performance, striking an optimal balance between system complexity and the performance, which is competitive in various scenarios.","Wed, 17 Jan 2024 19:09:11 UTC (3,166 KB)[v2] Fri, 19 Jan 2024 02:19:13 UTC (3,167 KB)"

Herein, we employ neural operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the recent work of Lee and Shin, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network architectures, if properly pre-trained, can achieve very accurate solutions of Riemann problems for real-time forecasting.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 23:45:14 UTC (2,244 KB)"

Condensin, in addition to performing loop extrusion, creates localized clusters of chromatin in the nucleolus through transient crosslinks. Large-scale simulations revealed three different dynamic behaviors as a function of timescale: slow crosslinking leads to no clusters, fast crosslinking produces rigid slowly changing clusters, while intermediate timescales are optimal for producing flexible clusters that mediate gene interaction. By mathematically analyzing different relative scalings of the two sources of stochasticity, thermal fluctuations and the force induced by the transient crosslinks, we predict these three distinct regimes of cluster behavior. Standard time-averaging that takes the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force to zero can predict the existence of clusters, but not their timescale-dependent lifetimes. Accounting for the interaction of both fluctuations from the crosslinks and thermal noise with an effective energy landscape does capture the timescale-dependent flexible cluster lifetimes. No clusters are predicted when the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force are taken to be large relative to thermal fluctuations. This mathematical perturbation analysis illuminates the importance of accounting for stochasticity in local incoherent transient forces to predict emergent complex biological behavior.","Fri, 12 Jan 2024 22:32:56 UTC (2,901 KB)"

"144","Nonreciprocal Quantum Batteries","Borhan Ahmadi, PaweÅ Mazurek, PaweÅ Horodecki, Shabir Barzanjeh","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Nonreciprocity, arising from the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, has become a fundamental tool in diverse quantum technology applications. It enables directional flow of signals and efficient noise suppression, constituting a key element in the architecture of current quantum information and computing systems. Here we explore its potential in optimizing the charging dynamics of a quantum battery. By introducing nonreciprocity through reservoir engineering during the charging process, we induce a directed energy flow from the quantum charger to the battery, resulting in a substantial increase in energy accumulation. Despite local dissipation, the nonreciprocal approach demonstrates a fourfold increase in battery energy compared to conventional charger-battery systems. We demonstrate that employing a shared reservoir can establish an optimal condition where nonreciprocity enhances charging efficiency and elevates energy storage in the battery. This effect is observed in the stationary limit and remains applicable even in overdamped coupling regimes, eliminating the need for precise temporal control over evolution parameters. Our result can be extended to a chiral network of quantum nodes, serving as a multi-cell quantum battery system to enhance storage capacity. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement using current state-of-the-art quantum circuits, both in photonics and superconducting quantum systems. In a broader context, the concept of nonreciprocal charging has significant implications for sensing, energy capture, and storage technologies or studying quantum thermodynamics.","Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:50:03 UTC (1,121 KB)"

Wolterink, Karo Becker, Matthias Heinrich, Stefan Scheel, Alexander Szameit","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","One of the most promising nascent technologies, quantum computation faces a major challenge: The need for stable computational building blocks. We present the quantum-optical realization of non-adiabatic holonomies that can be used as single-qubit quantum gates. The hallmark topological protection of non-Abelian geometric phases reduces the need for quantum error correction on a fundamental physical level, while the inherent non-adiabaticity of the structures paves the way for unprecedented miniaturization. To demonstrate their versatility, we realize the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, experimentally show their non-Abelian nature, and combine them into a single-qubit quantum algorithm, the PQ penny flipover. The planar geometry of such designs enables them to be substituted for the conventional directional coupler meshes currently in wide-spread use in photonic quantum architectures across all platforms.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 16:44:45 UTC (1,038 KB)"
"146","On Clustering Coefficients in Complex Networks","Alexander I Nesterov","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","The clustering coefficient is a valuable tool for understanding the structure of complex networks. It is widely used to analyze social networks, biological networks, and other complex systems. While there is generally a single common definition for the local clustering coefficient, there are two different ways to calculate the global clustering coefficient. The first approach takes the average of the local clustering coefficients for each node in the network. The second one is based on the ratio of closed triplets to all triplets. It is shown that these two definitions of the global clustering coefficients are strongly inequivalent and may significantly impact the accuracy of the outcome.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 19:07:18 UTC (347 KB)"

Its onset is actually governed by the scattering mean free path $\ell_s$ that provides crucial information on the medium micro-architecture. Here, we introduce a reflection matrix method designed to estimate this parameter from the time decay of the single scattering rate. Our method is first validated by means of an ultrasound experiment on a tissue-mimicking phantom. An in-vivo measurement of $\ell_s$ is then performed in the human liver. This study thus opens important perspectives for quantitative imaging whether it be for non-destructive testing or biomedical applications.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 12:58:44 UTC (3,537 KB)"

In comparison with confocal microscopy, apart from relying on extensive sample-staining procedures and long acquisition times, applying LM for 3D and multicolor imaging poses a considerable experimental challenge. In the current work, we provide a complete demonstration of an entry-level SRM technique - providing super-resolving capabilities with an experimental complexity level akin to that of confocal microscopy. Exchanging the confocal pinhole with a small pixelated detector, we use the inherent fluctuations of dye molecules as contrast for SRM. This contrast is processed into a super-resolved image through a process of pixel reassignment, a robust and deterministic algorithm. Since the fluctuation contrast is ubiquitous to organic markers, it does not require engineering of the blinking statistics through the sample buffer. Together with the built-in capabilities for multi-color and 3D imaging, shown in our work, it can become a natural extension to confocal microscopy - a straightforward first step into the realm of SRM.","Sat, 30 Dec 2023 15:26:53 UTC (753 KB)"

However, they are currently limited by: (i) the significant computational and human effort that must go into development and validation of potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, using the state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences, including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box and as a starting or ""foundation model"" for any atomistic system of interest and is thus a step towards democratising the revolution of ML force fields by lowering the barriers to entry.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 23:08:59 UTC (38,376 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 07:19:05 UTC (33,806 KB)"

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) with a multipixel interleaved architecture give the array an excellent spatial PNR capability. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the photon number resolution (SNRPNR) of the array will be degraded with increasing the element number due to the electronic noise in the readout circuit, which limits the PNR resolution as well as the maximum PNR number. In this study, a 16-element interleaved SNSPD array was fabricated, and the PNR capability of the array was investigated and analyzed. By introducing a level comparator circuit (LCC), the SNRPNR of the detector array was improved over a factor of four. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of the photon number on this SNSPD array with LCC, showing that the LCC method effectively enhances the PNR resolution. Besides, the system timing jitter of the detector was reduced from 90 ps to 72 ps due to the improved electrical SNR.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 13:00:15 UTC (783 KB)"
