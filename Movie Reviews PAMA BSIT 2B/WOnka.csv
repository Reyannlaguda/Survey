"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."
"Wonka","roxlerookie","20 January 2024",NA,"I found myself skipping through, watched the beginning and the last quarter. It's awful on many levels.I loved Paddington, both in fact. They were wonderful.I also loved Ronald Dahl s books as a kid.I also remember fondly the Johnny Depp version.Now this one was an infuriating mess. Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."
"Wonka","Padreviews","14 December 2023",NA,"WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."
"Wonka","Xstal","30 December 2023",NA,"The voyages out at sea are being halted, as there are caramels you need to make quite salted, beans of cocoa to enhance, along with magic and a dance, but there are those who will curtail, and have you halted. Fickelgruber, Prodnos, Slugworth guard their brands, and there is no way they will let you get your hands, on their produce and confection, there will be no insurrection, an Oompa-Lumpa's guaranteed, to make some fans. But with the help of hard done Noodle and some friends, who Mrs Scrubbit's small print penalties have penned, you can treat hundreds and thousands, melt away all the cartel's scams, in a cinematic smooth, refined, sweet blend.Great performances, beautiful story, sweet and delightful throughout."
"Wonka","BruceWayne3","18 February 2024",NA,"How are the graphics for the new movie worse than the old movie ?It literally makes no sense why the graphics are so bad
You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."

This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."

I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","BruceWayne3","18 February 2024",NA,"How are the graphics for the new movie worse than the old movie ?It literally makes no sense why the graphics are so bad
You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."

This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."

A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."
"Wonka","Padreviews","14 December 2023",NA,"WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."
"Wonka","roxlerookie","20 January 2024",NA,"I found myself skipping through, watched the beginning and the last quarter. It's awful on many levels.I loved Paddington, both in fact. They were wonderful.I also loved Ronald Dahl s books as a kid.I also remember fondly the Johnny Depp version.Now this one was an infuriating mess. Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."
"Wonka","Padreviews","14 December 2023",NA,"WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs

I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."

The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."

Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."
"Wonka","roxlerookie","20 January 2024",NA,"I found myself skipping through, watched the beginning and the last quarter. It's awful on many levels.I loved Paddington, both in fact. They were wonderful.I also loved Ronald Dahl s books as a kid.I also remember fondly the Johnny Depp version.Now this one was an infuriating mess. Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."
"Wonka","Padreviews","14 December 2023",NA,"WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."
"Wonka","Xstal","30 December 2023",NA,"The voyages out at sea are being halted, as there are caramels you need to make quite salted, beans of cocoa to enhance, along with magic and a dance, but there are those who will curtail, and have you halted. Fickelgruber, Prodnos, Slugworth guard their brands, and there is no way they will let you get your hands, on their produce and confection, there will be no insurrection, an Oompa-Lumpa's guaranteed, to make some fans. But with the help of hard done Noodle and some friends, who Mrs Scrubbit's small print penalties have penned, you can treat hundreds and thousands, melt away all the cartel's scams, in a cinematic smooth, refined, sweet blend.Great performances, beautiful story, sweet and delightful throughout."
"Wonka","BruceWayne3","18 February 2024",NA,"How are the graphics for the new movie worse than the old movie ?It literally makes no sense why the graphics are so bad
You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."
"Wonka","roxlerookie","20 January 2024",NA,"I found myself skipping through, watched the beginning and the last quarter. It's awful on many levels.I loved Paddington, both in fact. They were wonderful.I also loved Ronald Dahl s books as a kid.I also remember fondly the Johnny Depp version.Now this one was an infuriating mess. Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens. Dreadful really.Even the cgi was bad. It's also pretty nihilistic as everybody is a terrible person, down to the church staff.We deserved better. And the legacy of this IP also deserved better."
"Wonka","Padreviews","14 December 2023",NA,"WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

And not enough catchy songs

I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me

The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Chamalet can't sing, which is a big deal given this happens to be a musical, and I dislike musicals.The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the characters are so clich√© yet incredibly bad, it's like an AI wrote a Dickens novel for chickens.

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."

It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."

A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

"Wonka","BruceWayne3","18 February 2024",NA,"How are the graphics for the new movie worse than the old movie ?It literally makes no sense why the graphics are so bad
You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."
"Wonka","Sleepin_Dragon","8 December 2023",NA,"Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city .

"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."

You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
"Wonka","imseeg","9 December 2023",NA,"Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder."
"Wonka","masonsaul","9 December 2023",NA,"On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timoth√©e Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout."
"Wonka","CANpatbuck3664","26 December 2023",NA,"Getting the audience to commit to a musical requires some work. Wonka has a few extra hoops to jump through on top of that, they're building off of an existing property that they have to pay respects to as well. Establishing the world is paramount, we need to want to believe that Wonka could imagine these confections and use only the rarest of ingredients to make people fly or experience an entire party in a moment. Clearly Wonka's production budget was huge and the creative team uses it to great effect. The fantastical energy the movie is cultivating is dependent on how real a chocolate flower looks or how plausible it is for a giant chocolate vault guarded by monks seems. The practical sets were impressive and I wasn't annoyed by Wonka's use of CGI. It all blended together well and I have to credit everyone involved for selling it as successfully as they did. I'll caution that if you can't accept any fantastical elements, this movie is going to annoy you very quickly. You need to suspend disbelief and accept some dark quirks (like indentured servitude for orphans) on top of this completely fanciful adventure.I read Charlie and Chocolate Factory as a kid, I enjoyed it and I've seen the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I think you'll enjoy Wonka more if you're a fan of the property but it also works as a standalone story. Wonka's continued optimism in the face of failure and difficulty could go either way depending on how you see it (inspiring or annoying? You decide). His journey to becoming a successful chocolate maker isn't exceptionally deep but it's charming and it's clearly made with kids in mind. I think from that perspective, Wonka triumphs in taking the audience on a journey that should delight the younger members of the family and keep the less judgmental adults entertained.As much as there's lavish production design and a light and bouncy script, Wonka lives and dies by Timothee Chalamet's performance Willy Wonka. Timothee is an ascending talent and I liked him in the sci-fi epic Dune. I think Wonka proves he's got the talent to do almost anything. He does great work here, he brings a lot of kindness and warmth to the character and he anchors Wonka capably. He also skips around the fact that he's not the strongest vocalist. He still delivers during the musical numbers and there's some good sleight of hand to shield him from having to belt it out like it's a Broadway musical. The supporting cast is great across the board, they're all playing it big (Olivia Coleman, Tom Davis, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton and Keegan-Michael Key are all enjoyably hammy as the villains of the piece) but that's also the genre and while they could have been toned down a little, I had to put it aside as a concession to the tone of the film. Kudos to Calah Lane who's portraying Noodle, she's very earnest to the point of being potentially cheesy but that's more of result of her character than her acting.I wasn't planning to go see this movie in theatres but I went out with a couple of friends and I had a surprisingly good time with this film. The lavish production budget, well rounded cast and an inherent sweetness (no pun intended) to the proceedings stripped me of any preconceived bias. Timothee Chalamet's exemplary performance sealed the deal. Wonka still isn't in my wheelhouse and if you don't enjoy musicals, I'm hesitant to recommend it. But if you're attached to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory story or if you're in the mood to be swept away into a fantastical world of imagination, I think you'll enjoy Wonka wholeheartedly."
"Wonka","fiona_r_lamb","20 February 2024",NA,"I watched Wonka with my 6 and 7 yr old niece and nephew. None of us loved it. And I was really expecting to be WOWED. But it lacked magic for me. I thought Timothy Chalamet was insipid and weak, also he couldn't really sing; lacked the charisma Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder both had in spades.The only character that really entertained me was Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa and he wasn't on screen enough, alas. The Cartel trio fell flat altho' it was cool to see three of the cast members of Ghosts in this. The young girl Noodle - I really didn't believe her character tbh.The set also reminded me of Lisbon, Portugal, strangely. Just not enough pizazz and the music was not very memorable at all. My nephew complained about the singing.It was just meh for me and I'm sad about that."
"Wonka","Larsii90","17 December 2023",NA,"Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did."
"Wonka","davidallenxyz","24 December 2023",NA,"Trailers can be very instructive. After watching them, you would assume that Wonka is an origin travelogue starring young Willy and his first Oompa Loompa companion.Wrong!It's a musical set almost entirely in a fantasy town of chocolatiers with a large British supporting cast and barely any appearances by small orange men with green hair. Basically every scene featuring Hugh Grant is included in the trailer.I don't think the studio was very confident about this film (which is why they hid the songs and most of the characters from the trailer), so the rave reviews from the mainstream media must have been a pleasant surprise.But honestly, it's only an average film. Far, far behind the ""Paddington"" films from the same director.Here are the good points. The visuals are fantastic, beautifully capturing a fantasy town full of delicious chocolate. Perhaps a slight over-reliance on CGI but that is par for the course these days. Some of the cameo performances raise a laugh, Rowan Atkinson stands out as a corrupt priest, as do Olivia Colman and Tom Davis as unlikely lovers, and the triumvirate of devious chocolate makers. Plus Hugh Grant, obviously. And at least the storyline is easy to follow.But there is a lot that doesn't work.You have to start with Chalamet. He's quirky, he moves well, but he lacks warmth and texture. He's just forgettable as Wonka. The film invites comparisons with Gene Wilder's interpretation, but Timmy Tim doesn't even come close.Next up, the songs. No surprise that they cut them out of the trailer. They are weak. Generic routines that don't linger in the mind and don't add anything to the experience. Perhaps the only exception is a funny number performed by the chocolatiers called ""Sweet Tooth"".Third, which is a minor criticism but one which breaks the spell, is the smorgasbord of accents across the cast. Don't even try and understand if they mean anything, just accept how wrong it all sounds and move on.My final criticism is levied against the actual central theme of the story - Wonka's relationship with a young orphan girl called ""Noodle"" (a terrible choice of name). It hovers in the area between mawkish and cringeworthy and takes up most of the first half of the film. Oh, and she has a song written about her which is absolutely dreadful.It bears repeating that HUGH GRANT IS BARELY IN IT!Basically, if you are looking for a family-friendly film this winter that isn't completely awful, give Wonka a try.It seems that the bar has been set so low that the critics think this is special. It isn't. Please, please, please watch the Gene Wilder film instead and terrify your children in the old-fashioned way."
"Wonka","eddie_baggins","14 December 2023",NA,"Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timoth√©e Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be ""hip"" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"Wonka","kevin_robbins","18 December 2023",NA,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion."
"Wonka","DeltaHomicide","6 December 2023",NA,"I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film."
"Wonka","jgeorge4","17 December 2023",NA,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into ""Les Miz"" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out ""Master of the House.""One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up."
"Wonka","destiny_west","23 January 2024",NA,"I had to battle to finish watching Wonka. Every time characters burst into song I actually screamed at the screen ""stop bloody singing"" it was tedious, unimaginative and agonizing. I am positive that this film was not aimed at children. How could it be? There was nothing to endear them to it. Chalamet was dreadful as Wonka, he was insipid and flat. If this is meant to be a prequel to Wilder's Wonka, did they even watch it? Wilder's Wonka was enchanting, however he was also sinister. That is the whole point. You don't know if he loves kids or if he actually hates them. I think the only good thing about this version is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lompa, he was funny, but still, they strayed so far from the story line. Again how is a kid meant to fall in love with this film, like millions of kids fell in love with Wilder's version? Even today, if that comes on the television, one is compelled to watch it, because it takes you to a place - your imagination. Something that Wonka failed to do."
"Wonka","vassiliskounelis","22 January 2024",NA,"I recently had the opportunity to watch Wonka 2023, and I must admit that it left me with mixed feelings. Admittedly, fantasy films, especially musical ones, are not my usual cup of tea, and this cinematic experience proved to be no exception.From the outset, I found myself grappling with the pacing of the film. The storyline seemed to drag on, leaving me with the impression that the narrative was moving at a sluggish pace. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm for fantasy genres, especially when coupled with musical elements, contributed to my struggle to connect with the movie.One aspect that particularly disappointed me was the quality of the CGI. In my eyes, the visual effects appeared mediocre at best, failing to create the immersive and captivating experience that I had hoped for. The CGI elements felt lackluster and did not meet the standards I have come to expect in modern cinema.While I can appreciate the effort that went into creating Wonka 2023, I cannot overlook the fact that it did not align with my personal tastes. However, I acknowledge that taste in films is subjective, and for those who appreciate fantastical musicals, this movie may offer a delightful experience. Unfortunately, it fell short of leaving a positive impression on me."

A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10."
"Wonka","BA_Harrison","8 December 2023",NA,"Willy Wonka (Timoth√©e Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10."

Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10."
"Wonka","ICanSeeClearlyNowLorraineisGone","24 December 2023",NA,"I went into this thinking it was going to be just another cute paint by the numbers generic prequel banking on nostalgia. Boy was I wrong!Let me start by complimenting the marketing department. I had no idea this was a musical and glad I didn't. All of the songs caught me by suprise, including the big finale rehashing ""Pure Imagination"". They showed just enough in the trailers to peak interest but left out enough to be suprised at every turn. I really didn't know how this movie was going to end. That's rare these days.The characters were actually characters here. Everyone felt like they were there for a reason and not just thrown in last second. We get development, growth and everyone gets a decent amount of screen time. They did a great job of actually making you care about the people you're watching. Again, a lot of movies recently haven't taken the time to do that.People were complaining about the amount of diversity in this movie but they did something out of the ordinary here. Noodle is an essential character to the story with her own arch, motivations and dreams. Too often when we get characters like her, they're treated as support to the lead with zero humanity. We actually get to know this girl, learn about her family and in the end everything centers around her dreams coming true. I love how she's related to the villian and everything is a full circle moment. You do not have the same movie if Noodle isn't there. That's how it should be done.The acting was very camp and over the top, similar to all the 80s and 90s type of comedies we used to get. It was a breath of fresh air seeing comically expressive characters, especially the villians, hamming it up to the highest degree. The Paddington director knew what he was doing by allowing these three men to be cartoon villians come to life.The set design, the costume design, the cgi team and all the visionaries that made this possible really went out of their way. I was in awe the entire time at how gorgeous this film is. The colors pop in a way that's so reminiscent of the 1970's version. The CGI animals looked very convincing. You could tell some actual love and care went into making this. The team really put their all into that ending sequence, almost making you wonder if we'll ever get a sequel to this.I hope this young man's portrayal of Willy silenced a lot of doubters. I don't know much about Timothy nor was I fan before this but it seems he's one of the only movie stars of this generation and rightfully so. He's very easy on the eyes, conveys emotion well and suprised me with the singing and dancing. This casting and the way things turned out proves the internet isn't always right.As far as this being a prequel, I feel as though everything was done tastefully. They put in just enough Easter eggs for those who know the original to catch while not being so distracting it takes away from this current movie. The Oompa Loompa was well rendered and acted out well, garnering many laughs. The ending scene brings everything together so well it's hard to fight back tears. Something about this movie brought back that movie magic that we haven't had in a while.Everyone in my entire family left the theater saying how much they loved it! Kids laughed, everyone got excited for Mr. Bean and you could tell the entire theater was glued to their seats! This is how you do a prequel. Whatever formula that was used for this movie, please keep doing it! Warner Brothers outdid themselves on this one."
"Wonka","thesuthernman","14 January 2024",NA,"I loved the original, hated the remake, this one sits in the middle somewhere. It's definitely a mixed bag. I googled Timoth√©e Chalamet to see how old he was because had he been in his early twenties, I would have given him a pass for a very uninspired performance. As it is, he is 28. Old enough, with enough films under his small belt, to be better than he is.I got the feeling he watched more Depp than Wilder, unfortunately. You could see it in the smile. Wilder was crazy good and there is no expectation for anyone to equal him, it would still be nice to be more imaginative with the role.The storyline was a mish-mash of unfocused stereotypes and had a lack of real artistic heart. Someone sat with the script and tried to come up with what they thought an audience would want rather than what these characters and storylines demand. The story skipped around like a ball in a pinball machine. We get that it's fantasy, but at least create a world that functions on the basis of a well thought out set of rules. There was no world building here...just a snap of the fingers.The music was the most disappointing of all, especially compared to the original songs utilized. When you have great songs like Pure Imagination, you gotta be at least good enough to sit in the same room...these new songs weren't good enough to sit outside in the hallway.With all that said, this movie was charming in it's own way. Better than the typical superhero repeats, that's for sure."
"Wonka","Xstal","30 December 2023",NA,"The voyages out at sea are being halted, as there are caramels you need to make quite salted, beans of cocoa to enhance, along with magic and a dance, but there are those who will curtail, and have you halted. Fickelgruber, Prodnos, Slugworth guard their brands, and there is no way they will let you get your hands, on their produce and confection, there will be no insurrection, an Oompa-Lumpa's guaranteed, to make some fans. But with the help of hard done Noodle and some friends, who Mrs Scrubbit's small print penalties have penned, you can treat hundreds and thousands, melt away all the cartel's scams, in a cinematic smooth, refined, sweet blend.Great performances, beautiful story, sweet and delightful throughout."
"Wonka","BruceWayne3","18 February 2024",NA,"How are the graphics for the new movie worse than the old movie ?It literally makes no sense why the graphics are so bad
You could of made the flying chocolate look more realToo much singing
And not enough catchy songs
They should of spent more time on developing this and not having unneeded songsI liked the oompa loompa
I'm not sure why everyone was giving him a hard timeThe ending was very endearing
But, it's not what I wanted
Focus on wonka
Not noodles family situationI wanted to give this a higher score
The graphics ruined it for me
There was definitely some funny parts
The movie was entertaining
Just the execution wasn't there."
"Wonka","magiciancolin","16 January 2024",NA,"As a fan of the Gene Wilder film and someone who can enjoy the Johnny Depp film. This was not it. No connection to these films and with that, should not be advertised as a prequel. This is it's own story and a messy one at that. When writing the screenplay they definitely didn't go and watched not read the original source material. The Oompa Loompa was WAY to small and Wonka was NOT A MAGICIAN! HIS HAT WAS NOT AN ENDLESS portal and he had no magic powers. The stupid chocolate recipes were annoying and yes, the original film and book had make believe recipes, but this film was too much. I need to know who thought TIMOTHEE could sing, because they should be fired as they ruined ""Pure Imagination"" there are a few original songs none are good except one and that's why this is 1 star."
"Wonka","bb52366","9 December 2023",NA,"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you."
"Wonka","idospasjody","2 March 2024",NA,"This could have been so good given the technology that they have these days but they miss the mark by a mile. It was so boring that my husband and I stopped watching it halfway through and then watched the second half a day later only because we paid for it. What they should have done was taking the opportunity to show how Willy Wonka created the chocolate factory. Instead they did the total opposite no. Wonka factory and the only oompa loompa that you see is one and they only show him probably a total of 3 minutes throughout the whole movie. They spend so much time on nothing, the story just kept lagging on and on. It was a snoozer with no storyline. Save yourself money and wait until it's free. So disappointing."
"Wonka","ubik-79634","6 December 2023",NA,"Origin stories can be hit (""Wicked"" the musical) or miss (who even remembers ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?). On that scale ""Wonka"" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame ""Wonka"". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of ""The French Dispatch"" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe ""Wonka""."
"Wonka","imaxxing","9 December 2023",NA,"Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That ""edge"" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's ""Pure Imagination,"" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10."
